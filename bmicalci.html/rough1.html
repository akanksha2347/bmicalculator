      <h1>Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator</h1>
      <p>BMI or Body Mass Index is a broad measure of your body fat to work out if your weight is healthy. 
        The number is based upon the ratio of your height and weight. Medical professionals around the world use this to assess the health
         issues related to body weight and fat accumulation.</p>
      <p>A healthy BMI shows that your diet and physical activity are adequately balanced. 
        BMI misbalance is often seen as a precursor to lifestyle-related health issues such as diabetes, cholesterol growth, 
        heart ailments, etc. And recently, health care has been associated with inflation as the cost of hospitalization is on the rise.</p>

          BMI is an ad hoc measure of fatness. While it does well for people within the average height range, 
          it becomes less accurate for weights at left and right tails. 
          BMI will show a taller person as fatter than they are, and shorter people as thinner than they are.</p>

        <p>BMI = Weight / Height^2</p>

            <h1>How to Calculate BMI?</h1>
            <p>To calculate the BMI, you need to have the following information handy with you:</p>         
           <p> a) Your Height</p>                    <p> b) Your Weight</p>                   
            <p>Multiply the height by itself and then divide the weight with that number to calculate Body Mass Index.         
                 The formula for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) is -</p>                  
            <p>BMI = Weight / Height^2</p>                    
            <p> For example, if your weight is 67 kgs, and your height is 1.7 meters, your BMI should be:</p>                    
            <p>BMI = 67/ (1.7)2 = 23.183</p>                   
         <p>You can take this value and compare it to the BMI chart to see the possibility of being obese or normal weight.</p>

        <h1>What is BMI (Body Mass Index)?</h1>
        <p>Body Mass Index is a ratio of your physical attributes â€“ height and weight. 
          The purpose of BMI is to measure the degree of obesity. 
          A short but fat person may weigh less than a tall but lean person. 
          The ideal weight range also changes as per the heights of men and women. 
          BMI Helps you determine if you fall under healthy weight range. 
          Surprisingly, the BMI was a brainchild of a mathematician and not a physician. 
          Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet a Belgian mathematician introduced the measure to assist
           the government in measuring the obesity levels of the population.
        </p>
        <p>The simplicity of the measurement makes it one of the most popular methods of assessing obesity in adults. 
          Obesity is linked with a range of physical and mental health issues or lifestyle problems.</p>
        <p>However popular, BMI is not a reliable indicator of obesity, as it does not measure the fat level of the body. 
            Physiologically, you will need a few more measurements such as waist size to height, for a more accurate measure of obesity.</p>
        <p>Estimating weight simply indicates a possibility of obesity for normal individuals. 
            But if you are a gym enthusiast or a sportsperson, you are likely to have a higher BMI than others. 
            However, that does not mean you are obese.</p>

            <h2>BMI Chart</h2>
              <p>BMI chart gives a range of BMI numbers for adults from 25 years to 50 years. 
                  The numbers have been pre-calculated based on height and weight combinations.
                   You can compare the numbers directly on the Weight Status and understand if your BMI is healthy.</p>
